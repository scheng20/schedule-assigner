# Schedule Assigner
A simple program that assigns a given list of people to a given schedule.

## Introduction
This was my final project for the Software Construction Course (CPSC 210) I took during my undergrad at the University of British Columbia (UBC). Although I had started building programs prior to taking this course, I learned how to truly design programs instead of just piecing code together until it worked. Although the funtionalities of this program are not as extensive as what I have built before, this project was mostly a learning experience on how to design, write and test cohesive code to create truly robust programs.
